# Discord Time Rich Presence

A lightweight, Go app that publishes your current local time in your Discord Rich Presence status in real-time.
I built this because I liked this feature that slack has which shows your local time to anyone who clicks on your profile.
Discord lacked this due to their stance on _privacy_ lol.

## What it does

This app creates a Discord Rich Presence that shows:
- **It's **: Your local time in HH:MM format (e.g., "It's 3:25 PM EST")
- **üìÖ Date**: Current date (e.g., "üóìÔ∏è Mon, Jun 23")
- **Live Updates**: Automatically refreshes every 30 seconds

Your Discord profile will display this as a "Playing" status that your friends can see!

## Features

- No external dependencies beyond standard library
- Communicates directly with Discord using the official RPC protocol
- Prompts for Discord Client ID if not provided
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Single binary with no complicated build setup

## Instructions for Non Technical Users

## Just give me the binaries OR executable OR exe
- You can download the latest release from https://github.com/siddarthkay/discord-show-local-time/releases
- just unzip the binary that corresponds to your Environment
- Run the executable and it should connect to your Discord Desktop App

## Instructions for Technical Users

- **Discord Desktop App** (Rich Presence doesn't work with browser Discord)
- A **Discord Application ID** (free to create)

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Discord Application

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **"New Application"**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "My Time Display")
4. Copy the **Application ID** from the General Information page

> **Tip**: The Application ID is an 18-19 digit number like `1234567890123456789`

### 2. Enable Discord Rich Presence

In Discord Desktop App:
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Activity Privacy**
2. Enable **"Display current activity as a status message"**

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
# Option 1: Set environment variable
export DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="your_application_id_here"
./discord-time-presence

# Option 2: Interactive prompt (app will ask for Client ID)
./discord-time-presence
```

## Example Output

```
Discord Time Rich Presence
=============================
Connecting to Discord using Client ID: 1234567890123456789
